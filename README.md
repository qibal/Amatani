This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

make file .env
and put this code 
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://api.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=''

NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_APPWRITE_ID=123123
NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION_PRODUK_ID=123123123
```

 run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
